   negative -- (integer) the number of negative COVID-19 tests on this date
   hospitalizations -- (integer) the number of new hospitalizations
	   for COVID-19 on this date


REQUEST: /state/{state-abbreviation}/cumulative

RESPONSE: a single JSON dictionary representing the cumulative
statistics for the specified state. The dictionary will have the
following fields.

   start_date -- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "2020-10-08")
   end_date -- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. "2020-03-11")
   state -- upper-case two-letter state abbreviation (e.g. "MN")
   deaths -- (integer) the total number of deaths between the
	   start and end dates (inclusive)

   	   between the start and end dates (inclusive)
   negative -- (integer) the number of negative COVID-19 tests

   	   between the start and end dates (inclusive)


REQUEST: /states/cumulative?sort=[deaths|cases|hospitalizations]

RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each representing the
cumulative COVID-19 statistics for each state. The dictionaries are
sorted in decreasing order of deaths, cases (i.e. positive tests), or hospitalizations,
depending on the value of the GET parameter "sort". If sort is not
present, then the list will be sorted by deaths. Each dictionary
will have the same fields as in the
/state/{state-abbreviation}/cumulative endpoint response.
